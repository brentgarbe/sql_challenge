# sql_challenge
This repository is for the SQL homework.
In this assignment, we had to query six databases of employee data with individual id numbers, salary data, managers, departments, etc. We had to use junction tables to query data from multiple sources and merge it together. The point of this was so there was not a tremendous amount of duplicated data repeated over and over as it would be if everything were combined into a single database. This assignment taught not only how to query and return specific data, but how to efficiently combine multiple datasets and use them as if they were all a single table.
